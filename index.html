        <p>Disney used to be best known for its children’s animation. But over the last decade the House of Mouse has become the House of Hulk. Princesses and neotenous animal companions haven’t vanished. In terms of market share and screen dominance, they’ve been shouldered aside by the thundering pectorals and power beams of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), with its Iron Men and various betighted Captains. </p>

        <p>Like many of the irresistibly catchy pop songs it showcases, Sing 2 follows a tried and tested formula. Hapless koala bear promoter Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) must risk failure, humiliation and being chucked out of the window of a luxury hotel to put on a show. His animal stars (including two pigs, an elephant, a gorilla and a porcupine) overcome various obstacles to perform to a non-stop soundtrack of pop and rock bangers. What’s more, everything rests on luring a reclusive star – in this case Clay Calloway (Bono) – out of retirement. It’s a formula, after all, that made a considerable hit out of the first film, which was also written and directed by Garth Jennings. While there are no surprises whatsoever here, the perky charm remains.</p>

            An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.
